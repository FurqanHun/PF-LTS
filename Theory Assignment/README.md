# Theory Assignment

## Question 1

Take a 3 digit number as input, find if the number is an Armstrong number and if the number is an Armstrong number print the three digits one by one on separate lines. [An Armstrong number of three digits is an integer such that the sum of the cubes of its digits is equal to the number itself. For example, 371 is an Armstrong number since 3^3 + 7^3 + 1^3 = 371]
*Bonus: Check the number of digits first. If the number contains less than 3 digits, print “error”*

## Question 2

Take a 4 digit number as input and find the sum of digits of the number. If the sum isodd, print the square of the sum otherwise print the cube of the sum.

## Question 3

Take two numbers as input and swap the numbers without using an extra variable. Print the value of the two variables with their names before and after swapping the values.

**Sample Input:** 5 10
**Sample Output:**
Num1 before swapping is: 5
Num2 before swapping is: 10
Num1 after swapping is: 10
Num2 after swapping is: 5

## Question 4

Take a two digit number as input and print the number in reverse order.
*NOTE: Do not print the digits of the number in reverse order; instead reverse the number and then print*

**Sample Input:** num = 267
**Sample Output:** revnum = 762

## Question 5

Write a program that prints the following menu then asks the user to enter the choice and based on the choice performs the task.

****Menu****
1- Armstrong number
2- Digit sum
3- Swap num
4- Reverse num

### Sample Run 1:
Enter your choice: 1
**************************
Enter number: 367
Number is Armstrong
3
6
7

### Sample Run 2:
Enter your choice: 2
**************************
Enter number: 3645
Sum is 18
324

## Question 6

Write a program that takes decimal numbers as input from the user and converts those numbers into the base specified by the user, until the user chooses to exit (i.e. user enters ‘E’).

### Sample Input:
To convert into Hexadecimal Enter ‘H’
To convert into Octal Enter ‘O’
To convert into Binary Enter ‘B’

*Menu to be displayed to the user*
To exit Enter ‘E’
>> H
Enter the decimal number : 100

### Sample Output:
Decimal number 100 in base 16 is : 64
*Note: You are NOT allowed to use any other placeholders other than %d and %c*

## Question 7

Consider the sequence given below.
0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89...

Write a program which takes a non-negative integer as input and generates the sequence depending on that input:

### Examples
1. If the user inputs 5, following sequence should be generated i.e. 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5
2. If the user inputs 0, following should be generated i.e. 0
3. If the user inputs 11, the following sequence should be generated i.e. 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89

## Question 8

Write a program that prompts the user for a positive integer as input, printing the respective hollow triangle.
